# tcodetools
unix/linux command line tools for working with variable length self-synchronizing codes


Currently only tools for the raspberry pi are provided... I intend to provide the sources 
for these tools shortly so that they can be compiled for use in any UNIX or linux environment.
These tools enable on eto create and work with varibale-length self synchronizing T-codes.

The process of constructiong the codes can be approached in several ways.

Starting from an alphabet and selecting prefix codes and copy factors in turn to augment 
the alphabet and resultant code sets recursively.

Or to select an alphabet and then use a single string to specify the set through a process of decomposition.
