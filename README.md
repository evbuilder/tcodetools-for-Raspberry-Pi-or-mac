# tcodetools
unix/linux command line tools for working with variable length self-synchronizing codes


Currently binary executables for Raspberry pi are available.  I intend to provide the sources 
for these tools shortly so that they can be compiled for use in any UNIX or linux environment.
These tools enable one to create and work with the varibale-length self-synchronizing T-codes.

The process of constructiong the codes can be approached in several ways.

Starting from an alphabet and selecting prefix codes and copy factors in turn to augment 
the alphabet and resultant code sets recursively.

Or to select an alphabet and then use a single string to specify the set through a process of decomposition.
